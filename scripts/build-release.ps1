.SYNOPSIS
  Build MikeRust release MSI installers for Windows x86_64 and ARM64,
  bundle the matching native DLLs (onnxruntime + pdfium), and collect
  the artefacts under ./dist/.

.DESCRIPTION
  Pipeline per target architecture:
    1. Make sure the native runtime DLLs for the target arch exist by
       running scripts/fetch-native-libs.ps1 (idempotent â€” skips DLLs
       already on disk).
    2. Hand-craft a per-arch JSON overlay for `bundle.resources` that
       names only the matching arch's DLLs and write it under
       target/.tauri-overlay-<arch>.json.
    3. Invoke `tauri build --bundles msi --target <triple>` with both
       the base config and the overlay so the WiX bundler picks up the
       correct DLLs (and only those, not double-sized cross-arch).
    4. Copy the produced .msi from
       `target/<triple>/release/bundle/msi/` into ./dist/, renaming
       with a short `_x64` / `_arm64` suffix to keep both architectures
       coexisting.

  No manual operator step needed: a clean checkout can do
  `pnpm --dir frontend install` then `./scripts/build-release.ps1` and
  end up with two MSIs in dist/, each carrying the right native DLLs
  next to the binary.

  Cross-toolchain: each build is launched through the matching
  `VsDevCmd.bat -arch=<target> -host_arch=<host>` so the right
  `cl.exe` / `link.exe` are on PATH regardless of how the caller's
  shell was opened. The script auto-discovers Visual Studio via
  `vswhere.exe` and fails fast with the exact workload id if the
  required MSVC component isn't installed.

.PARAMETER Target
  Which architecture(s) to build. Defaults to `both`.
.PARAMETER Clean
  Wipe `target/<triple>/release/bundle/` before each build.
.PARAMETER FrontendInstall
  Run `pnpm --dir frontend install --frozen-lockfile` before building.
  Useful in CI; in a developer checkout it's usually redundant.
.PARAMETER SkipNativeLibs
  Skip the auto fetch-native-libs.ps1 invocation. Useful if you have
  already pinned a custom DLL build into libs/ that you don't want
  overwritten.

.EXAMPLE
  ./scripts/build-release.ps1                          # both, fresh DLLs as needed
  ./scripts/build-release.ps1 -Target x64 -Clean
  ./scripts/build-release.ps1 -Target arm64 -SkipNativeLibs

    # to reach the repo root where libs/ actually lives. The DEST side
    # is relative to the install's `resources/` folder â€” the Rust
    # loaders look for `<exe_dir>/resources/libs/<lib>/win-<arch>/<dll>`,
    # which is exactly what we ask the WiX MSI bundler to produce.
    #
    # The empty `beforeBuildCommand` is essential: this overlay is used
    # by the *bundle* phase, which runs after cargo has already produced
    # mike-tauri.exe and after we have swept the stray provider DLLs.
    # The default `pnpm --dir ./frontend build` would write fresh
    # timestamps into frontend/dist, invalidating mike-tauri's cargo
    # fingerprint, triggering a full re-link, triggering ort's
    # copy-dylibs step again, re-emitting the same 617 MB CUDA EP DLL
    # we just deleted. Silencing pnpm here keeps cargo a true no-op so
    # the swept DLLs stay swept and the bundler ships a lean MSI.
    # Bundle JSON-driven config registries alongside the binary.
    # The runtime `crate::presets::*_dir` resolvers walk ancestors of
    # the executable looking for `config/<dir>/`, so dropping the

    # find them without an env-var override. The walker happily
    # recurses into per-domain subfolders (workflow-presets/legal/,
    # workflow-presets/insurance/, â€¦) â€” the glob source preserves
    # the relative subpath under each root. `corpora-plugins/` is
    # deliberately excluded: the plugin system reads its own dir
    # via a separate resolver and shouldn't conflict, and pre-built
    # installs don't ship third-party plugins anyway.

    #    gliner2 still flips every EP feature on. The build script
    #    fetches the full ONNX Runtime distribution (a 617 MB CUDA
    #    EP DLL on x64) and `copy-dylibs` replicates them next to
    #    the output binary. Tauri's MSI bundler auto-includes every

    #    161 MB x64 MSI carrying CUDA/TensorRT/shared EPs we never
    #    use (we load onnxruntime.dll dynamically out of
    #    libs/<arch>/, CPU EP only). Sweeping these between cargo
    #    and the bundler keeps the MSI lean without forking

    # frontend assets are bundled at WiX time in phase 2 â€” so we can
    # safely skip `pnpm build` here too. Phase 2's `tauri build` then
    # runs `pnpm build` via `beforeBuildCommand`, finds cargo already
