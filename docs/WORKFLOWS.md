# Workflows, Tabular Reviews, and Assistants — User Manual

This manual explains the three core artefacts Specter exposes for
repeatable AI work — **Workflows**, **Tabular Reviews**, and the
**Assistant** chat — how they relate, and how to design new ones for
your own profession. Specter ships with 14 built-in workflows aimed at
legal practice, but the underlying model is **domain-agnostic**: the
same building blocks describe medical-record reviews, M&A IC memos,
real-estate due diligence, HR resume screening, insurance claims
triage, patent landscapes, compliance audits, and dozens of other
document-driven tasks. The legal slant is in the *built-ins*, not in
the framework.

This manual is written for an end user who wants to *prepare* new
workflows in the UI. For the contributor track (editing the shipped
constants in TypeScript, adding new practice areas, etc.) see the
"Going beyond the UI" section at the bottom.

## 1. The mental model

There are three artefacts. Read this section twice — the rest of the
manual assumes you know which one you are designing at each step.

```

**Pick a workflow type up front**:

- **`type: "assistant"`** — for any task whose output is **free-form
  text or a generated document**. Examples: "Summarise this credit
  agreement", "Draft a response letter", "Generate a Conditions
  Precedent checklist as a .docx". A user starts a chat, picks the
  workflow, attaches documents, sends the message.
- **`type: "tabular"`** — for any task whose output is **structured
  rows × columns**. Examples: "Extract parties, term, governing law
  from each NDA in this folder", "List all change-of-control clauses
  across these 30 agreements", "Triage 50 insurance claims by severity
  and missing documentation". A user creates a Tabular Review, attaches
  the documents, hits Run, and gets a table back.

The decision is **the shape of the output**, not the topic. A "summary
of regulatory disclosures" can be an assistant workflow (one long
markdown summary per chat) **or** a tabular workflow (one row per
disclosure with columns Topic / Severity / Citation). Same domain,
different shape.

---

## 2. Workflow anatomy

A workflow is a row in the `workflows` table. Six fields matter at
authoring time:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `title` | Shown in the workflow list and in the chat composer's workflow picker. Keep it action-oriented: "Review NDA terms", not "NDA workflow". |
| `type` | `"assistant"` or `"tabular"`. Drives where the workflow appears in the UI and how the model is asked to respond. |
| `domain` | Top-level professional vertical. One of `legal` (default), `medical`, `finance`, `fiscale`, `real_estate`, `hr`, `insurance`, `ip`, `compliance`, `gdpr`, `pa`, `others`. Filters list views and is inherited by tabular reviews. See §5 for the practice/domain distinction. |
| `also_applicable_to` | *(optional)* Array of **additional** domains the workflow should also surface under, beyond the primary `domain`. A workflow relevant to more than one vertical (e.g. fixed-asset analysis → both `fiscale` and `finance`) is registered **once** and listed in every applicable domain's picker — no duplicate JSON. Empty/omitted ⇒ shows strictly under `domain`. Each entry is validated against the canonical domain set (non-canonical or redundant-primary entries are dropped — at load for presets, on save for DB rows). Mirrors the DOCX-template field of the same name. Built-in presets set it in their JSON; user-created workflows (DB rows, migration 0034) set it in the editor via the **Additional domains** tag picker. |
| `practice` | A sub-category tag *within* a domain. Used for filtering the workflow list. Pick from the shipped list (see §5) or type a custom one. |
| `prompt_md` | The instructions to the model, written in Markdown. This is the most important field. See §7 for guidance. |
| `columns_config` | (tabular only) An array of column definitions. Each column has a `name`, a `prompt`, and an optional `format`. See §3. |

Two flags are managed by the system, not by the author:

- `is_system: true` for built-in workflows — uneditable, undeletable
  (you can hide them, you can duplicate them to make a custom variant).
- `user_id` — null for built-ins, your user id for your own workflows.

---

## 3. Tabular Reviews — column model

A tabular workflow defines a **schema**. Running the workflow over N
documents produces an N × M table (M = number of columns).

Each column in `columns_config` has:

```ts
{
  index: 0,                              // ordinal — controls column order
  name: "Governing Law",                 // header shown in the table
  prompt: "What law governs this agreement? Cite the clause.",
  format: "text",                        // optional — see below
  tags: []                               // optional — UI filter hints
}
```

The `prompt` is **per-cell**. The model reads it together with the
document content, the workflow-level `prompt_md` (which sets the
overall posture), and any general context the user provided in the
review setup, then produces the value for that one cell.

**Available formats** (drives display and post-processing — `text` is
the default if you omit it):

| Format | Use for | Display |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | Free-form answer, short paragraph. | Rendered as a single-line string with hover for the full text. |
| `bulleted_list` | Multiple items the model should enumerate. | One `•` per line. The prompt should say "list … each on its own line". |
| `number` | A plain count or integer. | Right-aligned numeric cell. |
| `currency` | A monetary value with currency code. | Formatted with locale (e.g. `€ 1,250,000`). |
| `monetary_amount` | Like `currency` but also captures the unit and basis. | Three sub-fields (value / currency / note). |
| `percentage` | A 0-100 number with a % sign. | Right-aligned, suffix `%`. |
| `yes_no` | Boolean. | Pill: green YES / red NO / grey N/A. |
| `date` | An ISO date. | Locale-formatted, sortable. |
| `tag` | A single short label from a small enum (e.g. severity, status). | Coloured pill. The prompt should say "answer with one of: low / medium / high". |

A practical rule of thumb: **the column prompt should describe both
*what* the model is looking for AND *how* to format the answer.** The
`format` setting changes the rendering but doesn't constrain the
model — that's what the prompt is for. A `number` column whose prompt
says "How many parties are involved?" will get a clean integer; the
same column without that instruction may get "There are seven parties
in this agreement", which renders weirdly.

---

## 4. Assistants and workflow injection in chat

The Assistant view is the chat interface. By default it's a generic
conversation: you type, the model responds, you attach documents, etc.

A workflow can be injected into a chat **only if it's an
`"assistant"`-type workflow**. The flow:

1. In the chat composer, click "Add workflow".
2. Pick an assistant workflow from the list (built-ins + your own).
3. Type any additional context you want and send.

Mechanically the frontend prefixes the message with a marker like
`[Workflow: Generate CP Checklist (id: builtin-cp-checklist)]`. The
backend recognises the marker, fetches the workflow's `prompt_md`, and
prepends it to the conversation as system instructions for that turn.
Subsequent messages in the same chat reuse the same context implicitly
until you remove the workflow.

**Why "assistant" workflows only?** Tabular workflows have no "chat"
shape — they produce a table. They're invoked through the Tabular
Review view, not the chat composer. If your workflow needs to be
chat-driven, set its `type` to `"assistant"`.

---

## 5. Domain vs practice — top-level vertical and the sub-category

Specter uses **two** orthogonal categorisation fields, introduced
in migration 0018:

- **`domain`** — the broad professional vertical the artefact belongs
  to. Always one of twelve shipped values: `legal` (default), `medical`,
  `finance`, `fiscale`, `real_estate`, `hr`, `insurance`, `ip`,
  `compliance`, `gdpr`, `pa`, `others`. Validated at the API boundary —
  unknown values fall back
  to `legal` on create, are rejected on update. New domains can be
  added by editing `crate::domain::DOMAINS` on the backend and
  `Domain` in `frontend/.../shared/types.ts` — no SQL migration needed,
  rows that already reference an unshipped domain keep working.
- **`practice`** — a sub-tag *within* a domain. Free string. The
  shipped dropdown lists 19 legal practice areas (`General
  Transactions, Corporate, Finance, Litigation, Real Estate, Tax,
  Employment, IP, Competition, Tech Transactions, Project Finance,
  EC/VC, Private Equity, Private Credit, ECM, DCM, Lev Fin,
  Arbitration, Others`); for non-legal domains, pick `Others` and
  type your own (e.g. `Cardiology`, `Property Inspection`, `Resume
  Screening`).

### Domain-vs-practice in plain terms

| Scenario | `domain` | `practice` |
|---|---|---|
| A law firm doing M&A work | `legal` | `Corporate` |
| A bank's IC analyst writing M&A memos | `finance` | (custom: `M&A`) |
| A patent attorney prosecuting filings | `legal` | `IP` |
| A patent agent (non-lawyer) doing FTO searches | `ip` | (custom: `FTO`) |
| A cardiologist reviewing patient charts | `medical` | (custom: `Cardiology`) |
| A claims adjuster triaging fire-loss claims | `insurance` | (custom: `Property — Fire`) |

The same word can appear in both columns ("Finance" is a legal
practice **and** a domain) — the two cohabit because law firms work
*on* those domains, while practitioners work *in* them.

### Inheritance & filtering

- The workflow list, tabular reviews list, projects list, and global
  documents list each have a domain filter chip at the top. The chip
  defaults to "All domains".
- A project's domain propagates to documents uploaded under it (the
  upload handler reads `projects.domain` and stamps it on the new
  document row). For global documents (no project), the user picks the
  domain at upload time; otherwise the schema defaults to `legal`.
- A tabular review inherits the workflow's domain on creation. The
  inheritance is not enforced on edit — you can re-tag a review to
  bridge cross-domain analyses.

Neither field has any effect on the model's behaviour. They're UI
categorisers and filter keys; put behaviour-changing instructions in
`prompt_md`.

---

## 6. Writing a good `prompt_md`

The `prompt_md` is what makes the workflow useful. Treat it as a
hand-off note to a smart contractor who's about to look at the
documents for the first time. Markdown is allowed — headings, lists,
code blocks, bold.

**For assistant workflows**, structure suggested:

```markdown
## Role and goal
You are a [profession] reviewing [doc type]. The goal is to [outcome].

## What to read first
Skim the [specific section]. Identify [signal].

## How to answer
Reply with a [structure]:
- [Section 1]
- [Section 2]
- A short flag list of anything missing.

## Things to double-check
- [Pitfall 1]
- [Pitfall 2]

## Tools
[Tell the model what tools to use, if any — e.g. generate_docx for an
output document.]
```

**For tabular workflows**, the `prompt_md` sets the **overall posture**
and each `column.prompt` does the per-cell work. Pattern:

```markdown
## Goal
This review extracts the key terms of [doc type] across [N] documents.

## Reading order
For each document, first identify [anchor]. Then answer the columns in
order.

## Style
- One-line answers; cite the clause number in parentheses where helpful.
- If the document doesn't address a column, answer "Not addressed" —
  do not invent.
```

Then each column prompt focuses on **one specific extraction** and
**the answer shape**:

- Good: `"What is the governing law of this agreement? State the
  jurisdiction (e.g. 'New York', 'England & Wales') and the clause
  number. If silent, answer 'Not specified'."`
- Bad: `"Governing law"` (too vague — you'll get inconsistent shapes)

**Three universally useful clauses to add to most prompts**:

1. **"Cite the clause/section/page you took this from."** Mike's
   citation system surfaces these inline as clickable pills.
2. **"If the document is silent on this, answer X — do not invent."**
   Forces an honest fail-mode instead of hallucination.
3. **"Be concise; output the answer only, no preamble."** Stops the
   model from saying "Sure, I'll be glad to help! …" in front of every
   answer.

## 7. Step by step — creating a new workflow

### 7.1 Assistant workflow

1. Go to **Workflows** in the sidebar.
2. Click **+ Create new**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Title** (action-oriented).
   - **Type**: `Assistant`.
   - **Practice area**: pick from the list or use `Others`.
   - **Prompt**: write your `prompt_md` following the structure in §6.
4. Save.
5. To use it: go to **Assistant**, attach the relevant document(s),
   click "Add workflow", pick yours, send your question.

### 7.2 Tabular workflow

1. Go to **Workflows** → **+ Create new**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Title**, **Type**: `Tabular`, **Practice area**.
   - **Prompt**: the workflow-level instructions (posture + style — see §6).
3. Add columns one by one:
   - **Name**: header text.
   - **Prompt**: per-cell extraction instruction.
   - **Format**: pick from the table in §3.
4. Save.
5. To use it: go to **Tabular Reviews** → **+ New review**, pick the
   workflow, attach the documents, hit Run.

## 8. Examples across professions

These are illustrative — copy them, adapt to your own data.

### 8.1 Medical — Patient record extraction (tabular)

- **Practice**: `Others — Medical Records Review`
- **Workflow prompt**: "You are a clinical analyst reviewing patient
  charts for a longitudinal cohort study. For each chart, extract the
  fields below. Cite the page number. If a field is not in the chart,
  answer `Not recorded` — do not infer."
- **Columns**:

| Name | Format | Prompt |
|---|---|---|
| Patient ID | `text` | "What is the patient ID or MRN on this chart? Page reference required." |
| Age at intake | `number` | "What is the patient's age at the date of the first visit recorded? Give an integer in years." |
| Primary diagnosis (ICD-10) | `text` | "What is the primary diagnosis? Provide the ICD-10 code if present, else the textual diagnosis." |
| Comorbidities | `bulleted_list` | "List the patient's documented comorbidities, one per line. Do not include negative findings." |
| Last visit date | `date` | "Date of the last clinical encounter recorded in this chart. ISO format." |
| Smoker | `yes_no` | "Is the patient currently a smoker? Answer YES / NO / N/A based on the social history section." |
| Risk tier | `tag` | "Assign a tier: `low`, `moderate`, `high`. Base on age + comorbidities + most recent labs. State your reasoning briefly." |

### 8.2 Finance — M&A IC memo summary (assistant)

- **Practice**: `Corporate` or `Others — M&A`
- **Workflow prompt**:

```markdown
## Role and goal
You are an analyst preparing a one-page IC memo from the attached
information memorandum and accompanying due diligence files.

## Output structure
Produce a Markdown document with these sections in this order:
- **Transaction at a glance** — 3 bullets (target, sector, deal size).
- **Strategic rationale** — 2 short paragraphs.
- **Financial highlights** — table: FY-3 / FY-2 / LTM / Run-rate, rows
  for Revenue / EBITDA / EBITDA margin / Net debt.
- **Key risks** — bulleted list, max 6.
- **Open diligence items** — bulleted list of things the docs don't
  cover.

## Style
- No marketing language. Skeptical, factual tone.
- Cite specific schedules/exhibits where helpful.
- If a section can't be filled from the docs, say so explicitly.
```

### 8.3 Real estate — Property inspection checklist (tabular)

- **Practice**: `Real Estate`
- **Workflow prompt**: "You are reviewing engineering inspection
  reports for a real-estate acquisition. For each report, extract the
  condition assessment by trade. State the page reference for each
  finding."

  Roof condition (`tag`: good/fair/poor), HVAC age years (`number`),
  Electrical compliance (`yes_no`), Outstanding items (`bulleted_list`),
  Estimated CapEx 12 months (`currency`).

### 8.4 HR — Resume screening (tabular)

- **Practice**: `Others — Recruiting`
- **Workflow prompt**: "Screen each CV against the role spec attached
  to this review. Be objective; cite the exact phrases from the CV
  that support your answer."

  (`number`), Required skills present (`bulleted_list`), Skills
  missing (`bulleted_list`), Compensation expectation (`currency`),
  English level inferred (`tag`: native/fluent/intermediate/basic),
  Recommendation (`tag`: advance/hold/reject), Rationale (`text`).

### 8.5 Insurance — Claims triage (tabular)

- **Practice**: `Others — Insurance`
- **Workflow prompt**: "Triage each claim packet. Flag any packet
  where documentation is incomplete or where the loss description
  doesn't match the policy coverage."
- **Columns**: Claim number (`text`), Date of loss (`date`), Cause of
  loss (`tag`: fire/water/wind/theft/other), Reserve amount
  (`currency`), Documentation complete (`yes_no`), Missing items
  (`bulleted_list`), Coverage match (`yes_no`), Triage priority
  (`tag`: urgent/standard/low).

### 8.6 IP — Patent landscape (tabular)

- **Practice**: `IP`
- **Workflow prompt**: "Summarise each patent for a competitive
  landscape study. Cite claim numbers."
- **Columns**: Patent number (`text`), Filing date (`date`), Owner
  (`text`), Independent claim 1 paraphrase (`text`), Key technical
  feature (`bulleted_list`), Relevance to product X (`tag`:
  blocking/adjacent/orthogonal), Freedom-to-operate concern (`yes_no`).

### 8.7 Compliance — Audit findings register (tabular)

## 9. Working with built-in workflows

Specter ships 14 built-in workflows, all currently in the
legal/transactional domain (`Generate CP Checklist`, `Change of Control
Review`, `Credit Agreement Summary`, `NDA Review`, `SPA Review`, etc.).
They live as TypeScript constants in
[`frontend/src/app/components/workflows/builtinWorkflows.ts`](../frontend/src/app/components/workflows/builtinWorkflows.ts)
and are merged with your own user workflows at runtime.

In the UI:

- Built-ins have an "Intégrato" / "Built-in" badge.
- You cannot edit or delete a built-in.
- You **can hide** it (right-click → Hide) so it doesn't clutter your
  list. Hidden built-ins are reachable from the **Hidden** tab.
- You **can duplicate** it (right-click → Duplicate). The duplicate
  becomes your own editable user workflow — useful as a starting point
  for variants ("NDA Review — Italian jurisdiction tweaks").

**Tip — designing a new workflow for an unfamiliar domain**:

1. Find a built-in whose *shape* is closest to what you need (a
   tabular review with N columns, or an assistant that emits a .docx
   document, etc.).
2. Duplicate it.
3. Rewrite the title, practice, `prompt_md`, and column prompts to
   match your domain. Keep the structural scaffolding (column count,
   formats) for the first pass.
4. Run it on 2–3 real documents. Iterate on the column prompts.

---

## 10. Limits, gotchas, and known pitfalls

- **No DB seed for built-ins.** They live in the frontend bundle, not
  in the database. This means: deleting your `mike.db` doesn't lose
  them; but if you customise a built-in you have to duplicate it first
  (the original is immutable in your DB anyway).
- **Practice list is shipped.** Adding a permanent new practice area
  to the dropdown requires editing
  [`practices.ts`](../frontend/src/app/components/workflows/practices.ts)
  and recompiling. End users have `Others` + free text as the runtime
  escape hatch.
- **`columns_config` is JSON in the DB.** Schema changes to columns
  (renaming a column, changing a format) on an existing tabular review
  do not retroactively rewrite the cell values — you'll see mixed
  shapes until you re-run those rows.
- **No conditional columns.** Every column is filled for every row.
  If a column doesn't apply to some documents, instruct the prompt to
  answer `Not applicable` and rely on visual filtering in the table.
- **Column prompts can't reference other columns.** They're independent.
  If column B needs the result of column A, fold that logic into B's
  own prompt ("Identify the parties (column A's task), then for each
  party state their role").
- **Tabular review rerun policy.** Rerunning a row replaces all its
  cells. Rerunning a single cell replaces just that one. Rerunning a
  column re-runs that column across all rows.

---

## 11. Going beyond the UI

If you find yourself working in a non-legal domain regularly, three
upgrades make sense:

### 11.0 Add a new domain to the shipped enum

The 12 domains shipped today (`legal`, `medical`, `finance`,
`fiscale`, `real_estate`, `hr`, `insurance`, `ip`, `compliance`,
`gdpr`, `pa`, `others`) cover most professional verticals — the
`fiscale` (Italian tax/commercialista) vertical was added in v0.7.0
as a worked example of the full add-a-domain flow (see
`docs/piano_settore_fiscale.md`). To add another (e.g. `architecture`,
`journalism`):

1. Edit
   [`src/domain.rs`](../src/domain.rs): append the new identifier to
   the `DOMAINS` array. The backend validation auto-picks it up; no
   SQL migration needed (the column is a free TEXT field).
2. Edit
   [`frontend/src/app/components/shared/types.ts`](../frontend/src/app/components/shared/types.ts):
   add the new value to both the `Domain` union and the `DOMAINS`
   array constant.
3. Add a display label in each i18n catalogue under
   `Domains.values.<new_id>`
   ([`it.json`](../frontend/messages/it.json),
   [`en.json`](../frontend/messages/en.json),
   [`fr.json`](../frontend/messages/fr.json)).

Rebuild (or wait for HMR). The new domain appears in both the create
dropdown and the filter chip everywhere a Domain control is rendered.

### 11.1 Add a practice area to the shipped dropdown

Edit
[`frontend/src/app/components/workflows/practices.ts`](../frontend/src/app/components/workflows/practices.ts):

```ts
export const PRACTICE_OPTIONS = [
    // existing legal entries…
    "Others",
    "Medical Records Review",        // ← add your domain
    "Property Inspection",
    "Resume Screening",
] as const;
```

Also add an i18n entry per locale in
[`frontend/messages/it.json`](../frontend/messages/it.json),
[`en.json`](../frontend/messages/en.json),
[`fr.json`](../frontend/messages/fr.json) under
`Workflows.practiceLabels` so the new area renders with a proper
display name. Rebuild the frontend (or wait for the dev-mode HMR pass).

### 11.2 Ship a built-in workflow for your domain

Built-in workflows live as **JSON preset files** under
[`config/workflow-presets/<domain>/`](../config/workflow-presets/), loaded once at
startup by the backend and merged into the `/workflow` API response
with `is_system: true`. The on-disk JSON is the single source of truth
— no DB row is written, no rebuild required. To add one:

1. Pick the right domain subfolder (`legal/`, `medical/`, `insurance/`,
   etc.). Create the folder if it doesn't exist yet.
2. Write a new file `<slug>.json` shaped like the existing ones:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "builtin-<slug>",
     "title": "My New Workflow",
     "type": "tabular",
     "domain": "insurance",
     "practice": "Others — Insurance",
     "prompt_md": "## Goal …",
     "columns_config": [
       { "index": 0, "name": "Parties", "format": "text", "prompt": "…" }
     ]
   }
   ```
3. Restart `tauri dev` (or `cargo run`). The new preset appears
   alongside the existing ones in the workflow list, gated to the
   selected domain by the standard domain filter chip.

**Built-in workflows are read-only from the UI.** The
`update_workflow` / `delete_workflow` handlers use
`WHERE user_id = ?` filters, and presets have `user_id = NULL`, so
the API naturally refuses edits. The frontend additionally surfaces
`is_system: true` to grey out the edit/delete affordances. Users
**can** hide a built-in (the `user_hidden_workflows` table scopes
hiding per-user) or **duplicate** it to get an editable custom copy.

### 11.3 Ship a column-preset shortcut

Same story for column presets — they live under
[`config/column-presets/<domain>/<slug>.json`](../config/column-presets/) and feed
the "presets dropdown" in the AddColumnModal. Each file shape:

```json
{
    "name": "Parties",
    "match_pattern": "\\bpart(y|ies)\\b",
    "match_flags": "i",
    "format": "bulleted_list",
    "domain": "legal",
    "prompt": "List all parties to this agreement. …"
}
```

The regex (`match_pattern` + `match_flags`) auto-suggests this preset
when the user types a column title matching the pattern. Restart the
app to pick up new files.

### 11.4 Override the preset directory

Both registries respect environment variables for non-standard layouts:

- `MIKE_WORKFLOW_PRESETS_DIR=/path/to/dir` — points the workflow loader
  at an absolute path instead of walking ancestors.
- `MIKE_COLUMN_PRESETS_DIR=/path/to/dir` — same for column presets.

Useful when packaging the app or running in containers where the
working directory diverges from the source tree.
