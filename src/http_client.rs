//! Shared `reqwest::Client` factories with sane timeout defaults.
//!
//! Most of Specter's outbound HTTP — MCP probe / MCP dispatch, LLM
//! chat (non-streaming bits), and APAC corpus metadata fetches —
//! has no natural watchdog
//! upstream of `reqwest`. A network partition or a slow remote
//! server can leave a `spawn_blocking` task wedged for minutes,
//! pegging the dispatcher and tying up an HTTP-route worker.
//!
//! The previous pattern (`reqwest::Client::builder().build()`) used
//! reqwest's *implicit* defaults — no overall timeout, only a 30 s
//! connect timeout. This module fixes that without inviting every
//! caller to reinvent the wheel:
//!
//!   - `default()` — 60 s overall, 10 s connect. The right answer
//!     for **transactional** calls (single round-trip, no streaming).
//!     Use it for: MCP probes, corpus metadata, presets fetch.
//!
//!   - `streaming()` — 10 s connect, **no overall timeout**. Right for
//!     LLM streaming and SSE consumption where the server legitimately
//!     trickles the response over minutes. Pair with a per-event
//!     `tokio::time::timeout` upstream when you want a deadline.
//!
//!   - `bulk_download(secs)` — caller-specified overall timeout for
//!     long-running file downloads (HuggingFace model weights and
//!     ONNX bundles). The single configurable knob
//!     keeps the per-caller `Client::builder()` boilerplate out.
//!
//! All three set `native-tls` (the project default) implicitly via
//! reqwest features. None pass `danger_accept_invalid_certs` —
//! certificate pinning stays the platform default.
