//! Authoritative APAC legal-corpus connectors.
//!
//! Each corpus implements `LegalCorpusAdapter`. The routes layer takes
//! the resulting `CorpusDocument`, runs it through the same hash-keyed
//! cache layout that chat-attachments use (`data/storage/cache/<sha256>.<ext>`
//! + `<sha256>.txt`), and indexes it via the existing embedding service.
//!
//! The generic manifest adapter serves the shipped APAC sources.
//! The shared trait keeps source-language and cache handling uniform.
