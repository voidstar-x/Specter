/**
 * v0.6.0 — Global state for the "Modalità sicura locale" plug-and-play
 * install / cancel flow.
 *
 * Why this lives in a singleton store instead of the Settings component
 * that drives the UI: the user can navigate away from Settings → Modelli
 * LLM while a 3 GB pull is in flight, then come back. If we kept the
 * `installProgress` map and the per-id `AbortController` registry in
 * component-local `$state`, the unmount would lose both: the React/Svelte
 * lifecycle has no way to know that "the user just hid the panel" is
 * different from "the user is done with this install". The visible
 * symptom (reported 2026-06-07): user clicks Install → leaves Settings
 * → comes back → "Installa" is clickable again → second click fires a
 * SECOND parallel ensure stream → when the original pull completes the
 * UI suddenly has two downloads racing.
 *
 * The fix: keep both maps at module scope. They survive component
 * mount/unmount because the module is loaded once for the app's
 * lifetime. The component just reads `secureInstall.progress` reactively
 * and forwards user clicks to `secureInstall.install()` / `.cancel()`.
 *
 * The store is intentionally toast-agnostic — it takes
 * `onCancelled` / `onCompleted` / `onError` callbacks rather than
 * importing toastStore + i18n directly. Two reasons: (a) lets the same
 * store be driven from a future test harness without DOM, (b) keeps the
 * localised message wording in the calling component where the rest of
 * the section's strings already live.
