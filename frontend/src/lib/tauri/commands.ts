/**
 * Discover the axum backend base URL.
 *
 * The Tauri shell spawns the backend on a free port at startup and reports
 * it back via the `api_base_url` command. The first `invoke` can race the
 * backend startup: the WebView boots in ~100ms but mike's AppState (81
 * workflow presets + 30 column presets + 13 docx templates + 5 model
 * providers + DB migrations + ort init) takes ~1s to settle before
 * `port_tx` fires. In that window the command returns an empty string and
 * the old code immediately fell through to the `:3001` fallback, never
 * retrying — that's the "Network error: Failed to fetch" the user saw on
 * cold launch even though the backend was about to start a few hundred
 * ms later.
 *
 * Now we poll with exponential backoff up to 30 s: 50 ms, 75 ms, 113 ms…
 * capped at 1 s. The backend almost always reports its port within the
 * first second, so on the happy path this adds one or two extra IPC
 * round-trips. If we're not running inside Tauri (e.g. `vite dev`
 * opened in a regular browser for component dev), the very first
 * `invoke` throws — we bail out of the loop immediately to the
 * `VITE_API_BASE_URL` env var, then to the canonical localhost
 * default.
